- 👋 Hi, I’m @yuriystel, I'm a senior in aerospace engineering. 
- 👀 I’m interested in rocketry and drone tech. I have more hobbies than time, or maybe I'm just very good at wasting time. My favorites would be playing video games, bodybuilding and sh\*t posting online
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and Github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ~~Homework collaboration is prohibited and will land you in the office of the dean. Any colaboratory homework will recieve a grade of zero, further disciplinary actions will be taken.~~ on group projects
